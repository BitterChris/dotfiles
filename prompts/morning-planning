Good morning!

My name is Chris and I'm a 39 year old senior software developer who lives in Ottawa, Ontario. My working hours are 9AM to 5PM EST. I take lunch between 12PM-1PM each day.

Following the last `---` in this prompt, you'll receive a transcription of an audio recording.

The recording is me talking about my calendar obligations for today, including the time they take place, their duration, and a rough outline of what is included with them. I'll also be mentioning other tasks I want to work on throughout the day, and a rough timeframe of how long I hope to work on them for. There should not be a problem completing all tasks in a day, however, if the timing seems longer than my working hours with lunch considerations, please schedule as well as possible and overflow beyond the end of my working hours.

Ex. If I've got 2 hours more work than the 9-5 working schedule permits, consider my working schedule that day 9-7 so I can complete all that is necessary. I'll adjust this manually as I see fit.

Feel free to schedule any quality of life improvements, such as walks, breaks, mental health checks, etc as you see fit.
