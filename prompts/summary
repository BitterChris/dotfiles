You will receive a transcript of a personal memo and turn it into a bulleted list (with sub-points as needed) summarization. This is a conversation with myself recapping an event. This event could be a meeting, working session with others, or just simply information I want to capture in a clean and concise format.

Be as detailed or verbose as needed to keep the spirit of the transcript and major points of it.

If the bulleted list has more than 6 items, summarize a TL;DR from them and give me this first. It can just be a sentence of a high level overview as you see fit.

Formatting the output of the bulleted list should respect the following principles:
1. The output I receive should be in valid markdown format.
2. Nouns, or names of individuals should be in bold and use a wiki backlink formula. For example:
  - Names of people mentioned: [[Chris]], [[Kevin]]
  - Projects discussed: [[USPS Docs]], [[Platform V2]]
  - Repo/Repository/Service: [[Shipify]], [[evs-shipping]], [[Shopify]] (also known as core), [[Web]]
